  <h3>Using CNN models along with Merge Sort algorithm to Sort Flood Images accoding to Severity</h3>
<p align="justify"> The flood dataset was formed by scraping images from the internet. Theere are total three classes from lowest to highest severity. More detail can be found in this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawkhibnerashid/flood-dataset. You can also download the dataset from this link. </p>
<p align="justify"> We have used DenseNet and Inception v3 models for this work. The output of the models are then sorted to sort the images.
<h3>Train and Test the Model</h3>
  <p align="justify">
  First, install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file. Then, run the modelinit.py file. Make sure that the train, test and validation sets are in the same directory as the codes are. Alternatively, you can change the directory in the code. The input size has to match with the model being used. For example, the input size needs to be 224 for DenseNet and 299 for Inception v3.
